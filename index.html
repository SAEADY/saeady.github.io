            This website aims to reframe failure and show that it's not something to be afraid of or avoid but that it is essential to the artistic process. Failure is not the end of a project but a detour that can lead artists into new directions. By actively seeking and engaging with failure an artist can also learn from their mistakes and bring that forward into new projects. Through a gallery of inspiring failures, statements from other artists and some engaging activities which encourage experimentation and failure, I hope this website will serve as an inspiration to try new things and not be held back by our own conceptions of failure.

        <h2>Gallery of Failure</h2>
        <p>Failure is everywhere and in everything. While failure is often seen as the opposite of success the two actually often go hand in hand. The Gallery of Failure hopes to showcase that failure is part of the process and there are still many opportunities to succeed despite it and in certain cases because of it.  </p>

        <h1>Insights on Failure</h1>
        <h2> Still not convinced?</h2>

        <p> These articles and websites all focus on the benefits of failure. From a variety of sources and across a multitude of disciplines these sources seek to provide insight on how other artists deal with failure and incorporate it into their practice</p>

            <p> The Art of Failure is a journal article written and published by the National Endowment for the Arts. This article interviews artists, entrepeneurs and critics in a wide variety of domains and asks their insights on the fear of failure, the usefulness of failure and how failure has contributed to their success. </p> 


            <p>A website article on making mistakes and how people should actively try things that cause mistakes. Starts with examining the idea of perfection in artwork and what exactly constitutes a mistake if perfection is subjective. Then continues onto proving that imperfection can be more beautiful than perfection. It also elaborates on how making mistakes leads to more creativity and ideas. </p>

            <p>A book devoted on the lessons in design and failure. Specific chapter cited is devoted to failure specifically. Explores the different types of failure such as technical or social barriers as well as common factors that cause failure such as innatention, lack of ability, uncertainty etc... A portion of the chapter also focuses specifically on learning how to fail. This resource could be very beneficial in the hopes that understanding failure will make it less of something to be scared of and more something you can control and work with. </p>

       <p> Basically, a ceramics teacher split his class into two groups to test a theory. He told the first group they would be graded based only on the quantity of work made, while the second group would be graded on their work’s quality. The first group would have everything they made simply weighed to determine their grade, while the second group had to create a single perfect piece to get an A.

When it came time to grade, a surprising thing happened. The highest quality work came from the group being graded for Quantity (Nishiyama, 2019) </p>

    <h2>Exercises that promote experimentation</h2>
    <p> These ideas were taken from an article written by Naomi Zouwer. All the exercises here encourage experimentation and unpredicatably. By being unable to control certain factors, these exercises promote following along with the process and dealing with unexpected outcomes.</p>
<ul>
<li> Blind Contour Drawing <p> This exercise challenges you to look only at the subject you are drawing and not at the paper. Once the pen or pencil touches the paper you don't lift it until the piece is done. By not being able to look at the piece you're doing it takes away the fear of it not being pretty or nice and lets you just focus on trying to capture the subject. The not lifting the pencil also adds an element of unpredictability to the challenge </p></li>
<li> Bigger medium <p> The bigger medium prompt, challenges you to only work with bigger mediums. For example making a piece with only a bigger piece of charcoal, this forces you to stay working big and not focus on the details as well as adapt to the unique challenges of trying to get smaller details with a bigger material. This exercise can also be done with a bigger paintbrush, pastel, pencil whatever you want. </p></li>
<li> Making your own brushes <p> Similar to the bigger medium challenge this one focuses on using brushes that you can make yourself. There's lots of different options, try painting with a pencil, create bristles out of twigs, create a painting using only a napkin as the brush. The possibilities are endless and each one can offer unique challenges and mistakes to</p></li>
